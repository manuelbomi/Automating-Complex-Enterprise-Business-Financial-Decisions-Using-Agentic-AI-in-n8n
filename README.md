## Usage Examples  üí° 
Below are some examples of how the workflow can be used to automate enterprise business and financial decisions. Each example shows the user‚Äôs prompt, how the Agent reasons, and the final output.

### 1. Investment Analysis (NPV & IRR)
   
Prompt:
Evaluate a project with an initial investment of $50,000 and cash inflows of $15,000 per year for 5 years at a discount rate of 10%.

Agent Reasoning (tools used):
    ‚Ä¢ Detects need for financial calculation.
    ‚Ä¢ Uses Code Tool to compute Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR).
    
Output:
    ‚Ä¢ NPV ‚âà $6,137
    ‚Ä¢ IRR ‚âà 14.5%
    
    ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ The project is financially viable since IRR > discount rate.

### Example of how the question was posed at the Agent's prompt:
    I am evaluating a business expansion project that requires an upfront investment of $800,000 and will generate annual cash flows of $150,000 for 10 years. The discount rate is 8%.
   
    Can you: 1. Calculate the Net Present Value (NPV)
   
             2. Calculate the Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
   
             3. Advise whether this is a financially viable project

             4. Use all available tools including the code too
   
     ### AI Agent's Response:
     1. Net Present Value (NPV): The NPV of the investment is approximately¬†$206,512.21.
        
     3. Internal Rate of Return (IRR): The calculated IRR for this investment is approximately¬†18.33%.
        
     5. Financial Viability: Since the NPV is positive and the IRR exceeds the discount rate of 8%, the project is considered financially viable.
        
    Summary:
        ‚Ä¢ NPV: $206,512.21
        ‚Ä¢ IRR: 18.33%
        
        If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

### 2. Break Even Analysis
Prompt:
A product sells for $120, costs $45 per unit to make, and fixed costs are $250,000. How many units do we need to break even?

Agent Reasoning:
    ‚Ä¢ Identifies break-even formula: Fixed Costs √∑ (Price ‚Äì Variable Cost).
    ‚Ä¢ Uses Calculator Tool to compute.
    
Output:
    ‚Ä¢ Break-even units = 3330
    
    ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ The business needs to sell 625 units to cover costs. 


### Example of how the question was posed at the Agent's prompt:
      My company is launching a new product. The fixed costs are $250,000, the variable cost per unit is $45, and the selling price per unit is $120. 
      
      Can you: 1. Calculate the break-even point in units and dollars? 
      
               2. Determine how many units we need to sell to earn a profit of $100,000? 
               
               3. Use all the available tools including calculator and code tool
   
     ### AI Agent's Response:
      1. Break-Even Point:
      
        ‚ó¶ The break-even point is approximately¬†3,334 units.
        ‚ó¶ In terms of dollars, the break-even revenue can be calculated as: [ \text{Break-Even Revenue} = \text{Break-Even Units} \times \text{Selling Price} = 3344 \times 120 \approx $400,000 ]
        
      2. To earn a profit of¬†$100,000, you need to sell approximately¬†4,667 units.
     
   Summary:
    ‚Ä¢ Break-Even Point: ‚âà 3,334 units (‚âà $400,000 revenue)
    
    ‚Ä¢ Units to Earn $100,000 Profit: ‚âà 4,667 units

### 3. Marketing ROI Forecasting
Prompt:
If we spend $100,000 on a campaign that generates $250,000 in sales, what‚Äôs the ROI and payback period?

Agent Reasoning:

    ‚Ä¢ Uses Calculator Tool to compute ROI and payback.
    
Output:

    ‚Ä¢ ROI = 150%
    ‚Ä¢ Payback period = < 1 year
    
    ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Campaign is highly profitable.


### Example of how the question was posed at the Agent's prompt:
      I am planning a $50,000 digital marketing campaign expected to increase monthly sales by $12,000 for the next 6 months. The profit margin on sales is 30%.
      Can you:
      
        1. Calculate the return on investment (ROI)?
        
        2. Estimate the payback period?
    
        3. Tell me if this campaign is profitable?
   
   ### AI Agent's Response:
   
     1. Return on Investment (ROI): The ROI for the marketing campaign is approximately¬†-56.8%. 
     
     This indicates that the campaign is expected to result in a loss relative to the initial investment.
     
    2. Payback Period: The estimated payback period is approximately¬†13.89 months. 
    
    This means it would take nearly 14 months to recover the initial investment from the profits generated by the campaign.
    
    3. Profitability: Given the negative ROI, the campaign is not expected to be profitable, as the anticipated returns do not cover the initial investment.

### 4. Loan Amortization

Prompt:

For a $200,000 loan at 6% interest over 20 years, calculate the monthly payment and total interest paid.
    Agent Reasoning:
        ‚Ä¢ Uses Code Tool (Python) with amortization formula.
        
    Output:
    
    ‚Ä¢ Monthly Payment ‚âà $1,432
    
    ‚Ä¢ Total Interest ‚âà $143,680
    
    ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Useful for debt strategy planning.


### Example of how the question was posed at the Agent's prompt:

    I am taking a $300,000 business loan at a 6% annual interest rate, amortized over 5 years with monthly payments.
    
    Can you:
    
    1. Calculate the monthly payment?
    
    2. Generate an amortization schedule?
    
    3. Calculate the total interest paid over the loan period?
   
   ### AI Agent's Response:
   
    Monthly Payment: The monthly payment for the loan is approximately¬†$5,799.84.
    
    1. Amortization Schedule:
    
        ‚ó¶ The loan amount is $300,000.
        
        ‚ó¶ The annual interest rate is 6%.
        
        ‚ó¶ The loan is amortized over 5 years (60 months).
        
        ‚ó¶ Based on this structure, here is a simplified look at the first few months of the amortization schedule:
        

| Monthly | Payment | Interest Paid | Principal Paid | Remaining Balance |
| :------- | :----------: | :--------: | :----------: | :----------: |
| 1   | $5,799.84       | $1500.00    | $4,299.84 | $295,700.16 |
| 2 | $5.799.84         |    $1478.50   | $4,321.34 | $291,378.82 | 
| 3 | $5.799.84         |   $1458.99     | $4,340.85 | $287,037.96 | 
| 4 | $5.799.84         |   $1435.19    | $4,364.65 | $282,673.31 | 
| 5 | $5.799.84         |   $1416.24    | $4,383.60 | $278,289.71 | 
| ... | ...        |  ...  | ... | ... | 
| 60 | $5.799.84         |   $28.55    | $5,771.29 | $0.00 |                ‚ó¶ 

       
3. Total Interest Paid: The total interest paid over the loan period is approximately¬†$47,990.04.
   
Summary:

    ‚Ä¢ Monthly Payment: $5,799.84
    
    ‚Ä¢ Total Interest Paid: $47,990.04

### 5. Pricing Strategy
Prompt:
If we price a product at $50 with costs of $30 per unit, what‚Äôs the profit at 10,000 units sold?

Agent Reasoning:

    ‚Ä¢ Simple arithmetic via Calculator Tool.
    
Output:
    ‚Ä¢ Profit = $200,000
    
    ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Clear margin-based decision-making.


### Example of how the question was posed at the Agent's prompt:
     I am considering lowering the price of a product from $40 to $35 to boost volume. My variable cost per unit is $20 and fixed costs are $100,000. I currently sell 5,000 units per month.
     
    Can you:
    
    1. Estimate the new break-even point if we lower the price?
    
    2. Calculate how many additional units I need to sell to maintain the same profit level?

   ### AI Agent's Response:
   
    1. New Break-Even Point:
    
        ‚ó¶ New selling price = $35
        ‚ó¶ Variable cost per unit = $20
        ‚ó¶ Contribution Margin per unit = Selling Price - Variable Cost = $35 - $20 = $15
        ‚ó¶ Break-even point in units = Fixed Costs / Contribution Margin = $100,000 / $15 =¬†6,667 units.
        
    2. Additional Units to Maintain Profit Level:
    
        ‚ó¶ Current profit can be calculated as: [ \text{Current Profit} = (\text{Selling Price} - \text{Variable Cost}) \times \text{Current Units Sold} - \text{Fixed Costs} ]
        ‚ó¶ Current profit = ((40 - 20) \times 5,000 - 100,000 = 100,000 - 100,000 = 0) (this indicates zero profit at current pricing).
        ‚ó¶ To maintain the same profit level after reducing the price, calculate the new required volume: [ \text{New Required Volume} = ( 100,000 + \text{Fixed Costs}) / (\text{New Selling Price} - \text{Variable Cost}) ]
        ‚ó¶ Additional Units to Sell = New Required Volume - Current Volume = 6,667 - 5,000 =¬†1,667 additional units.

    Summary:
    ‚Ä¢ New Break-Even Point: 6,667 units
    ‚Ä¢ Additional Units to Maintain Same Profit Level: 1,667 units
